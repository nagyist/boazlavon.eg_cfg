# Execution-Guided Line-by-Line Code Generation 

Our paper presents a **fundamentally new approach** to code generation.

**EG-CFG** is an inference-time algorithm for code generation that injects real-time execution feedback directly into the model’s decoding loop. By incorporating dynamic runtime signals during generation, it steers the model toward solutions that are not only syntactically valid, but also functionally correct and executable.

Using the open-source **DeepSeek-V3** model, our experiments demonstrate that **EG-CFG** significantly improves code generation performance, achieving **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** results across various levels of complexity. This includes foundational problems like `MBPP` (96.6%) and `HumanEval` (99.4%), challenging data science tasks on `DS-1000` (69.9%), and competitive programming problems on `CodeContests` (60.6%). Furthermore, EG-CFG establishes new SOTA results on the more rigorous variants, `MBPP-ET` (73.0%) and `HumanEval-ET` (89.02%), highlighting the method's robustness and ability to generalize to complex coding challenges.

### Evaluation Limitations

We manually reviewed all 17 MBPP tasks that were not solved by DeepSeek-V3-0324 and found that 9 contain invalid unit tests, with some also having incorrect reference solutions. In these cases, the model-generated code is correct but marked as failed due to flawed benchmark tests.  Full details are available in the [`analysis/mbpp_analysis/`](./mbpp_analysis/) directory.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Launch Options
EG-CFG supports two ways to define and launch multiple agents:

### 🛠️ Option 1: Launch from Parameter Combinations

Use `dynamic_signals_params.json` to define a **set of decoding parameter values**, and automatically launch all combinations.

```bash
python eg_cfg/eg_cfg_grid.py \
  --dynamic-signals-params configs/dynamic_signals_params.json \
  --session-config-json configs/session_config.local.json
```

Example `dynamic_signals_params.json`:
```json
{
  "t": [0.7, 0.75],         # Sampling Temperatures
  "s": [3],                 # Number of Candidates (Beam Size)
  "d": [2, 3],              # Completion Horizon (lines)
  "k": [1],                 # New Dynamic Signal Frequency (lines)
  "prompt_type": ["deepseek_instruct", "long_code"]
}
```

This launches one agent for each combination of the above parameters (e.g., 2 × 1 × 2 × 1 × 2 = 8 combinations).  
All agents run in parallel with full synchronization support.

### 🛠️ Option 2: Launch from Config Strings

Use `dynamic_signals_configs.json` to define a **list of specific config strings**, each representing a complete decoding configuration.


```bash
python eg_cfg/eg_cfg_trails.py \
  --trials-json configs/dynamic_signals_configs.json \
  --session-config-json configs/session_config.local.json
```

Example `dynamic_signals_configs.json`:
```json
[
  "ns3t0.75d5k1_lci_ln",
  "ns2t0.9d3k1_lci_ln",
  "ns3t1.2d5k3_ln"
]
```
Each string is automatically parsed into a full configuration. The format includes:
- ns3 → 3 candidates (beam size)
- t0.75 → sampling temperature = 0.75
- d5 → completion horizon = 5 lines
- k1 → signal update frequency = every 1 line
- `_ln` or `_lci_ln` suffix → prompt type (`deepseek_instruct` or `long_code`)

This method is best when you want to **explicitly control and review** the exact configs.

### 🔧 Session Configuration File

Defines the runtime setup for each session as specified in `session_config.local.json` or `session_config.inference_endpoint.json`:

| Field                      | Description                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model_name`              | Model to use (local path or HuggingFace hub name)            |
| `gammas`                  | CFG guidance strengths (e.g., `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0]`)        |
| `deployment_type`         | `"local"` or `"inference_endpoint"`                          |
| `dataset`                 | Target dataset: `"mbpp"`, `"humaneval"`, or `"CodeContests"` |
| `results_dir`             | Root directory for saving results                            |
| `inference_endpoint_url`  | (if endpoint) API URL for inference                          |
| `inference_endpoint_api_key` | (if endpoint) API key for Fireworks                       |
| `use_global_cache`        | Avoid recomputing same completions                           |
| `debug_mode`              | Enable logging/debug information                             |
| `is_prod`                 | Run in production mode (disable debug/test toggles)          |
| `minimal_trace`           | Use final-state-only traces instead of full step-by-step traces |
| `exec_eval`               | Use the ExecEval evaluation for CodeContests dataset         |
| `exec_eval_host_ip`       | IP address of the ExecEval server (used only if `exec_eval` is `true`)  |
| `exec_eval_host_port`     | Port of the ExecEval server (used only if `exec_eval` is `true`)        |


## 🚀 SLURM Integration for Parallel Inference 
To maximize throughput, launch the following script **multiple times—once per available node**.  
The pipeline supports full synchronization across jobs, so no manual coordination is needed.  
Agents will automatically run in parallel.

```bash
./scripts/job_runners/inference_sbatch.local.sh
# Or monitor in watch mode
./scripts/job_runners/inference_sbatch.local.sh watch
```

## 📁 Results Directory Structure

Each trial is written under the path defined by `results_dir` in your session config.
For example:

```json
{
  "results_dir": "trials/local_results",
  "model_name": "deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct",
  "deployment_type": "local",
  "dataset": "mbpp",
  ...
}
```

This results in directories like:

```
trials/local_results/mbpp/deepseek-ai_deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct/ns2t0.75d2_ln/
```

The folder name encodes the run configuration:
- `s2` → 2 candidates
- `t0.75` → temperature 0.75
- `d2` → horizon 2 lines
- `_ln` or `_lci_ln` suffix → prompt type (`deepseek_instruct` or `long_code`)

Each config directory contains:
- One JSON per task and gamma (e.g. `task_id=395_gamma=1.0.json`)

### 🧪 JSON file format

Each file includes:
```json
{
  "code": "...",  # Model-generated Python code
  "results": {
    "assert ...": {
      "result": true,           # Whether test case passed
      "time": 0.123,            # Execution time in seconds
      "error": null             # Any runtime error (or null)
    }
  },
  "passed": true,              # True if all test cases passed
  "accuracy": 1.0,             # Fraction of passed test cases
  "general_error": null,       # Top-level failure unrelated to test cases
  "has_testcase_error": false, # True if any test case raised an exception
  "stats": {
    "start_time": "...",
    "end_time": "...",
    "input_tokens": 1234,      # Total prompt tokens
    "output_tokens": 456,      # Total generated tokens
    "duration": "00:01:23"     # Inference wall-time duration
  }
}
```

A successful solution is:
- `passed = true`
- `accuracy = 1.0`

These fields are used for filtering and reporting.

---

## 📈 Monitor Results

Solved task outputs are stored under the `solved_tasks/` directory within each trial.

For example:  
`trials/local_results/mbpp/deepseek-ai_deepseek-coder-1.3b-instruct/solved_tasks/`

Each JSON file in this directory corresponds to a task that was successfully solved (`"passed": true`) and includes the final code and execution metadata.

You can iterate over this folder to analyze solved tasks.

## 🔧 Submodules and Custom Modifications

Some core functionality in EG-CFG relies on **custom extensions of external libraries**, which are included as Git submodules and redirected into the conda environment via symlinks.

### 🛠️ Modified `transformers` Library

In local inference mode, we extend the internal decoding loop of the HuggingFace `transformers` library to support execution-aware generation.
Specifically, our modifications in `transformers/generation/utils.py` enable token-level integration of runtime feedback, allowing the model to dynamically condition on execution traces as described in Section 3 of the paper.
This integration is essential for realizing EG-CFG's line-by-line guidance mechanism during inference.

### 🛠️ Execution Tracing via `trepan-xpy`
We use the `trepan-xpy` debugger to execute partially completed code and extract execution traces during inference.
To support our framework, we extended the debugger to emit canonicalized traces — a consistent structure that captures all relevant runtime signals, regardless of whether the execution succeeds or fails.
This includes not only variable values and function calls, but also bytecode-level events such as instruction execution, enabling fine-grained introspection.
The canonical format allows us to easily manipulate the trace to retain only the information most relevant for guiding generation.

> These are included in `submodules/` and linked into `site-packages/` using:
> ```bash
> python scripts/redirect_env_to_submodules.py $PWD/submodules/
> ```

## 📚 Data
We evaluate EG-CFG on three widely used Python code generation benchmarks:

🔹 MBPP

The MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems) benchmark [Austin et al., 2021] includes 500 Python tasks, each with a natural language description, function name, and 3 unit tests. It is a popular dataset for evaluating basic code generation.

🔹 HumanEval

The HumanEval benchmark [Chen et al., 2021] consists of 164 hand-written Python programming tasks with hidden test cases. Each task defines a function signature and problem description, designed to measure functional correctness.

🔹 MBPP-ET & HumanEval-ET

We also evaluate on MBPP-ET and HumanEval-ET, extended test suites proposed in CodeScore [Dong et al., 2025]. These enhancements add more challenging edge cases and improve coverage, offering better estimates of real-world generalization.

🔹 CodeContests

The CodeContests benchmark [Li et al., 2022] is a suite of competitive programming problems designed to evaluate advanced algorithmic reasoning and problem-solving skills. Each task includes a problem description and multiple hidden test cases. Solutions are evaluated using the [ExecEval framework](https://github.com/ntunlp/ExecEval) [Khan et al., 2024]. Performance on CodeContests reflects a model’s robustness and problem-solving depth under competitive constraints.

🔹 DS-1000

The DS-1000 benchmark [Lai et al., 2022] is a collection of 1000 data science problems designed to test code generation capabilities on popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It provides a challenging evaluation of practical, domain-specific programming skills.

### 🧾 Prompt Format

We use two prompt types to ensure broad and reproducible evaluation:

#### 🔹 Official Few-Shot Prompt (DeepSeek-Coder)
We adopt the **official evaluation prompt** provided by DeepSeek-Coder’s GitHub [Guo et al., 2024]:
- Includes 3 few-shot examples before each target problem
- Matches the DeepSeek-Coder evaluation setting  
- Source: [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder GitHub](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder)

#### 🔹 Long-Code Prompt (ours)
In addition, we introduce a **long-code instruction-only prompt** that:
- Encourages line-by-line, traceable completions
- Follows stylistic constraints aligned with dynamic execution trace extraction
- Designed for EG-CFG’s runtime-guided generation  
- Detailed in Appendix A of our paper

---

### ☁️ Inference Endpoint

For large-scale model inference (e.g., using DeepSeek-V3-0324), we use [Fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai/) as the inference endpoint provider.
Fireworks supports **token-level log probabilities**, which are essential for performing Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during decoding.

No local GPU is required—all inference runs remotely on Fireworks infrastructure.

> Endpoint access is configured via `session_config.inference_endpoint.json` using your Fireworks API key and endpoint URL.
